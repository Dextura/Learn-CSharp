## How to Learn C#
- Have you ever wanted to develop a game? Or create a website? Or develop applications for a Windows computer? If so, learning C# is a great investment of your time.

- C# is an essential part of many of the technologies you use on Windows. For instance, C# powers many Windows background services, Microsoft’s .Net powers websites and  Windows games are written using the Unity framework.

- This guide will discuss the best way to learn C# online. We’ll walk you through a set of tips you can use to help guide your journey toward learning how to code in C#.

## What is C#?
- C#, which is pronounced as “C sharp,” is a programming language that was originally designed for Windows. The C# language was designed based on C and C++ and uses the object-oriented programming paradigm to offer a developer-friendly experience.
- The C# programming language is a high-level programming language, which means it uses a more simple syntax than other languages like C++. C# abstracts away most of the machine-level code, so you can focus more on programming. The C# language is good for beginners for these reasons.
- The C# language is used by the Unity engine to make games, the .Net framework to create websites, and more broadly for Windows application development.

## Why Should You Learn C#?
# C# has a good learning curve
- The name for the C# language was based on that of the C language. C# was designed to be an improvement on C. Although the name may be similar to C and C++, C# is often seen to have a shallow learning curve.
- C# is an object-oriented language, which means that it uses classes and objects to structure data. This programming paradigm allows you to reduce repetition in your code and better control how data is structured. For beginners, object-oriented languages are often preferred for these reasons.
- In addition, C# checks code when it is compiled and throws errors if there is a problem in your work. This can help you more easily identify errors in your work, and quickly iterate as you learn more about coding in C#.
# C# is backed by Microsoft
- The C# language was originally developed by Microsoft, and to this day it
This is important for a couple of reasons. First, it means that there is no shortage of great developer resources out there that you can use to help you master C#. Second, because Microsoft uses C# so heavily, there is little chance that this programming language will fall out of favor in the near future. So, learning C# is a good long-term investment.
- The language has been in development for around 20 years, and it is constantly being updated.
- Popular development tools like Visual Studio and Unity are based on C#. This means that it even less unlikely that this tool will see any significant decline in popularity any time soon. Deprecating C# would involve these tools having to move their code bases to another language which does not happen often.
# C# developers earn high salaries
- What do the salary prospects look like for people who know C#?

In the case of C#, there is only one word we can use to describe the salary prospects for skilled developers: favorable.
- According to Glassdoor, the average C# .Net developer commands a salary of $68,524 per year – that’s a large amount even for a job in tech. In addition, the average lead C# .Net developer earns a salary of $83,000, which shows that over time your skills will become even more valuable.
- When reflecting on these statistics, one thing becomes clear: learning how to code in C# can have a significant impact on your salary.

## What is C# Used For?
- C# is a general-purpose programming language. This means it has a wide range of uses. C# is used for programming applications for the Windows operating system and it is the language upon which the .NET Framework was built.
- Another common use of C# is for game development. Unity, one of the most popular game engines in the world, was built to support C#.
- What’s more is that C# is used for server-side web development. This is because .NET is built in with C#. .NET is used to create dynamic web pages and power the back-end of a website.

## How Long Does it Take to Learn C#?
- It will take you about two to three months to learn the basics of C#, assuming you devote an hour or so a day to learning. You may learn C# quicker if you study part-time or full-time.
- But, don’t let this figure mislead you. If you want to become a professional developer who codes in C#, you’ll need to spend a lot more time with the language. It typically takes at least a year to develop a firm understanding of C# that will get you far in a professional setting.
- Your learning journey will never be over. There will always be something new for you to learn. But, after a few months, you should have the knowledge you need to build some powerful applications by yourself.
